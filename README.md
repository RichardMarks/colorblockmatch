# colorblockmatch
A matching game made with HTML5 / JS

Match colored blocks to get a high score

## How to play
+ Play with the mouse. 

+ Click on a block and then click on a neighboring block to swap their positions.

+ When 3 or more blocks of the same color are aligned horizontally, or vertically, they are considered a match and will disappear, and you get points.

+ You start with 60 seconds to make as many matches as you can.

+ Anytime you match 3 or more blocks, you gain 2 seconds for each block in the match on your clock so you can play longer and get a higher score.

+ When the timer reaches zero, the game is over and your score is compared to the recent high score, if your score is higher, it will be the new high score.
